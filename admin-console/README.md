# OpenHub admin console client module

This module holds all web resources that make the client application (admin console) of OpenHub:

* JavaScript modules
* CSS styles
* images and fonts
* front-end dependencies

This module is built on and require these technologies:

* [NODE v7.x.x](http://nodejs.org) 
* [WebPack v1.x.x](https://webpack.github.io)
* [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react)
* [Redux.js](http://redux.js.org)
* [Karma test runner](https://karma-runner.github.io)
* [Radium](http://formidable.com/open-source/radium)


## Build requirements

You'll need the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (7.x.x and above) installed on your system.
Usage of the [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is perfectly fine.

## Making changes in admin-console-client

Resources in admin-console-client are served directly from the admin-console-client module, so you can develop against the
unoptimized version of the client.

## Details about the JavaScript build

To run the application in **development** mode, use npm scripts   

```
$ npm run dev
```


Or for with API mock-server proxy active use
```
$ npm run dev:mock
```


To build the app into a **dist** folder

```
$ npm run deploy
```

And to run unit tests 

```
$ npm test
```

To build the production ready app (into a **dist** folder) use:

```
$ npm run deploy:prod
```


## Development

#### Developer Tools

**We recommend using the [Redux DevTools Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd).**
Using the chrome extension allows your monitors to run on a separate thread and affords better performance and functionality. It comes with several of the most popular monitors, is easy to configure, filters actions, and doesnâ€™t require installing any packages.

However, adding the DevTools components to your project is simple. First, grab the packages from npm:

```bash
npm i --save-dev redux-devtools redux-devtools-log-monitor redux-devtools-dock-monitor
```


### Routing
We use `react-router` [route definitions](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#plainroute) (`<route>/index.js`) to define units of logic within our application. See the [application structure](#application-structure) section for more information.

## Testing
To add a unit test, simply create a `.spec.js` file anywhere in `~/tests`. Karma will pick up on these files automatically, and Mocha and Chai will be available within your test without the need to import them. Coverage reports will be compiled to `~/coverage` by default. If you wish to change what reporters are used and where reports are compiled, you can do so by modifying `coverage_reporters` in `~/config/project.config.js`.

## Deployment
App is deployable by serving the `~/dist` folder generated by `npm run deploy` (make sure to specify your target `NODE_ENV` as well).

### Static Deployments
If you are serving the application via a web server such as nginx, make sure to direct incoming routes to the root `~/dist/index.html` file and let react-router take care of the rest. If you are unsure of how to do this, you might find [this documentation](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/Histories.md#configuring-your-server) helpful.


### Configuration
Default project configuration can be found in `~/config/project.config.js`. Here you'll be able to redefine your `src` and `dist` directories, adjust compilation settings, tweak your vendor dependencies, and more. For the most part, you should be able to make changes in here **without ever having to touch the actual webpack build configuration**.
