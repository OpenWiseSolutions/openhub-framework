# OpenHub Framework Community

## Give us your feedback
OpenHub Framework mission is to build up the ESB exactly with the behaviour and functionality which developer needs for the project. 
With minimum expenses, with maximally effective and quick process of development, with automatic tools for everything what can be reasonably automated to solve time and effort, but still with the full access to the code for tuning, debugging or when requirements are somehow special.
OpenHub Framework is ESB dedicated to developers to make their work easy and interesting. Your live feedback from your projects and your 
experience with 
OpenHub Framework helps us to keep the right direction. If you have any comments, send it to us via email 
([openhub@openwise.cz](openhub@openwise.cz)) or join [OpenHub Framework StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/openhubframework).

## Contribute to the code
We welcome any new member of the community, who volunteers to add new piece of code to OpenHub Framework or fix the existing one, to write 
documentation or help others on forum. How to contribute is described on [GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) 

Generally it's very simple: you don't need to ask if you can help, you don't need to apply to join the team - all you do is you fork the repository of your choice. In your own fork you can implement and test any enhancements or fixes you would like to contribute. Once you feel your code is ready, just let us know by starting a pull request. The pull request informs the team that there is a new contribution ready to get merged into the main line of code.

## Contribute to forum and documentation
We welcome any new volunteers who help us create comprehensive [documentation](https://openhubframework.atlassian.net) and knowledge base on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/openhubframework).
