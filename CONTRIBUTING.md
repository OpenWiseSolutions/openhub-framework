# Cleverbus Community

## Give us your feedback
Cleverbus mission is to build up the ESB exactly with the behaviour and functionality which developer needs for the project. With minimum expenses, with maximally effective and quick process of development, with automatic tools for everything what can be reasonably automated to solve time and effort, but still with the full access to the code for tuning, debugging or when requirements are somehow special.
CleverBus is ESB dedicated to developers to make their work easy and interesting. Your live feedback from your projects and your experience with CleverBus helps us to keep the right direction. If you have any comments, send it to us via email ([development@cleverbus.org](development@cleverbus.org)) or join [CleverBus forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cleverbus).

## Contribute to the code
We welcome any new member of the community, who volunteers to add new piece of code to CleverBus or fix the existing one, to write documentation or help others on forum. How to contribute is described on [GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) 

## Be patiant
CleverBus has been developed for one year as proprietary software in [Cleverlance company](http://www.cleverlance.com). We decided to make it as open-source few months ago. We need to move everything from private to public systems (issues, wiki, build server, Maven repository etc.), translate everything to English and change our internal processes how we will use CleverBus. **Please be patiant, it's time consuming to make all these changes.**
