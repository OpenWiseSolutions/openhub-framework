Have you already noticed that most of integration projects consist of 80% from routine and only 20% are really new topics? Do you really want to spend so much effort on things which have already been solved before ? We don't.

In CleverBus world most of the operational infrastructure is ready out of the box. Also typical coding scenarios can be generated and only adjusted if you need to. And when you code something, there is a big chance that somebody already did the same before.  We offer you to profit from the wide community, not to code, just install.
Also repeating business scenarios can be downloaded from the catalogue and just plugged in into  your project.

And if you really face to something special and new, CleverBus does not limit you in any direction. There are no dark corners in your project. Who has ever had to deal with black box, sure understands ....

With CleverBus you have the whole source code in your hands and the community around, with many people ready to help.
